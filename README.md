## Customer Segmentation Project Readme

### Overview
This project utilizes K-means clustering and PCA to segment customers effectively. It involves data preprocessing, K-means for segmentation, and PCA for enhanced visualizations.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, scaling, and handling missing values.
2. **K-means for Segmentation**: Partitioning customers into clusters based on similarities.
3. **PCA for Better Visualizations**: Reducing dimensionality to extract key features and improve clustering accuracy.

### Libraries Used
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhancing visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing K-means clustering and PCA algorithms.

### File Structure
- **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing.
- **k_means_segmentation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for implementing K-means clustering.
- **pca_visualizations.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for visualizing data using PCA.
- **README.md**: This file.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the provided sequence for data preprocessing, K-means segmentation, and PCA visualizations.
